This tutorial teaches FIWARE users about batch commands and entity relationships. The tutorial builds on the data
created in the previous [store finder example](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Getting-Started) and creates and
associates a series of related data entities to create a simple stock management system.

The tutorial uses [cUrl](https://ec.haxx.se/) commands throughout, but is also available as
[Postman documentation](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Entity-Relationships/).

# Understanding Entities and Relationships

Within the FIWARE platform, the context of an entity represents the state of a physical or conceptural object which
exists in the real world.

## Entities within a stock management system

For a simple stock management system, we will only need four types of entity. The relationship between our entities is
defined as shown:

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Entity-Relationships/img/entities.png)

-   A store is a real world bricks and mortar building. **Store** entities would have properties such as:
    -   A name of the store e.g. "Checkpoint Markt"
    -   An address "Friedrichstraße 44, 10969 Kreuzberg, Berlin"
    -   A phyiscal location e.g. _52.5075 N, 13.3903 E_
-   A shelf is a real world device to hold objects which we wish to sell. Each **Shelf** entity would have properties
    such as:
    -   A name of the shelf e.g. "Wall Unit"
    -   A phyiscal location e.g. _52.5075 N, 13.3903 E_
    -   A maximum capacity
    -   An association to the store in which the shelf is present
-   A product is defined as something that we sell - it is conceptural object. **Product** entities would have
    properties such as:
    -   A name of the product e.g. "Vodka"
    -   A price e.g. 13.99 Euros
    -   A size e.g. Small
-   An inventory item is another conceptural entity, used to assocate products, stores, shelves and physical objects.
    **Inventory Item** entities would have properties such as:
    -   An association to the product being sold
    -   An association to the store in which the product is being sold
    -   An association to the shelf where the product is being displayed
    -   A stock count of the quantity of the product available in the warehouse
    -   A stock count of the quantity of the product available on the shelf

As you can see, each of the entities defined above contain some properties which are liable to change. A product could
change its price, stock could be sold and the shelf count of stock could be reduced and so on.

> **Note** this tutorial uses the following typographic styling :
>
> -   Entity types have been made **bold text**
> -   Data attributes are written in `monospace text`
> -   Items in the real world use plain text
>
> Therefore a store in the real world is represented in the context data by a **Store** entity, and a real world shelf
> found in a store is represented in the context data by a **Shelf** entity which has a `refStore` attribute.

# Architecture

This application will only make use of one FIWARE component - the
[Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Usage of the Orion Context Broker is sufficient
for an application to qualify as _“Powered by FIWARE”_.

Currently, the Orion Context Broker relies on open source [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) technology to keep
persistence of the context data it holds. Therefore, the architecture will consist of two elements:

-   The [Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which will receive requests using
    [NGSI-v2](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/OpenAPI/ngsiv2)
-   The underlying [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database :
    -   Used by the Orion Context Broker to hold context data information such as data entities, subscriptions and
        registrations

Since all interactions between the two elements are initiated by HTTP requests, the entities can be containerized and
run from exposed ports.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Entity-Relationships/img/architecture.png)

The necessary configuration information can be seen in the services section of the associated `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
orion:
    image: fiware/orion:latest
    hostname: orion
    container_name: fiware-orion
    depends_on:
        - mongo-db
    networks:
        - default
    expose:
        - "1026"
    ports:
        - "1026:1026"
    command: -dbhost mongo-db -logLevel DEBUG
```

```yaml
mongo-db:
    image: mongo:3.6
    hostname: mongo-db
    container_name: db-mongo
    expose:
        - "27017"
    ports:
        - "27017:27017"
    networks:
        - default
    command: --bind_ip_all --smallfiles
```

Both containers are residing on the same network - the Orion Context Broker is listening on Port `1026` and MongoDB is
listening on the default port `27017`. Both containers are also exposing the same ports externally - this is purely for
the tutorial access - so that cUrl or Postman can access them without being part of the same network. The command-line
initialization should be self explanatory.

# Prerequisites

## Docker and Docker Compose

To keep things simple both components will be run using [Docker](https://www.docker.com). **Docker** is a container
technology which allows to different components isolated into their respective environments.

-   To install Docker on Windows follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)
-   To install Docker on Mac follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/)
-   To install Docker on Linux follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

**Docker Compose** is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. A
[YAML file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiware/tutorials.Entity-Relationships/master/docker-compose.yml) is used
configure the required services for the application. This means all container services can be brought up in a single
command. Docker Compose is installed by default as part of Docker for Windows and Docker for Mac, however Linux users
will need to follow the instructions found [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

You can check your current **Docker** and **Docker Compose** versions using the following commands:

```console
docker-compose -v
docker version
```

Please ensure that you are using Docker version 18.03 or higher and Docker Compose 1.21 or higher and upgrade if
necessary.

## Cygwin for Windows

We will start up our services using a simple Bash script. Windows users should download [cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/)
to provide a command-line functionality similar to a Linux distribution on Windows.

# Start Up

All services can be initialised from the command-line by running the
[services](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Entity-Relationships/blob/master/services) Bash script provided within
the repository. Please clone the repository and create the necessary images by running the commands as shown:

```console
git clone https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Entity-Relationships.git
cd tutorials.Entity-Relationships

./services start
```

This command will also import seed data from the previous
[Store Finder tutorial](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Getting-Started) on startup.

> :information_source: **Note:** If you want to clean up and start over again you can do so with the following command:
>
> ```console
> ./services stop
> ```

# Creating and Associating Data Entities

## Creating Several Entities at Once

In the previous tutorial, we created each **Store** entity individually,

Lets create five shelf units at the same time. This request uses the convenience batch processing endpoint to create
five shelf entities. Batch processing uses the `/v2/op/update` endpoint with a payload with two attributes -
`actionType=APPEND` means we will overwrite existing entities if they exist whereas the `entities` attribute holds an
array of entities we wish to update.

To differenciate **Shelf** Entities from **Store** Entities, each shelf has been assigned `type=Shelf`. Real-world
properties such as `name` and `location` have been added as properties to each shelf.

#### :one: Request:

```console
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/op/update' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "actionType":"APPEND",
  "entities":[
    {
      "id":"urn:ngsi-ld:Shelf:unit001", "type":"Shelf",
      "location":{
        "type":"geo:json", "value":{ "type":"Point","coordinates":[13.3986112, 52.554699]}
      },
      "name":{
        "type":"Text", "value":"Corner Unit"
      },
      "maxCapacity":{
        "type":"Integer", "value":50
      }
    },
    {
      "id":"urn:ngsi-ld:Shelf:unit002", "type":"Shelf",
      "location":{
        "type":"geo:json","value":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[13.3987221, 52.5546640]}
      },
      "name":{
        "type":"Text", "value":"Wall Unit 1"
      },
      "maxCapacity":{
        "type":"Integer", "value":100
      }
    },
    {
      "id":"urn:ngsi-ld:Shelf:unit003", "type":"Shelf",
      "location":{
        "type":"geo:json", "value":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[13.3987221, 52.5546640]}
      },
      "name":{
        "type":"Text", "value":"Wall Unit 2"
      },
      "maxCapacity":{
        "type":"Integer", "value":100
      }
    },
    {
      "id":"urn:ngsi-ld:Shelf:unit004", "type":"Shelf",
      "location":{
        "type":"geo:json", "value":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[13.390311, 52.507522]}
      },
      "name":{
        "type":"Text", "value":"Corner Unit"
      },
      "maxCapacity":{
        "type":"Integer", "value":50
      }
    },
    {
      "id":"urn:ngsi-ld:Shelf:unit005", "type":"Shelf",
      "location":{
        "type":"geo:json","value":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[13.390309, 52.50751]}
      },
      "name":{
        "type":"Text", "value":"Long Wall Unit"
      },
      "maxCapacity":{
        "type":"Integer", "value":200
      }
    }
  ]
}'
```

Similarly, we can create a series of **Product** entities by using the `type=Product`.

#### :two: Request:

```console
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/op/update' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "actionType":"APPEND",
  "entities":[
    {
      "id":"urn:ngsi-ld:Product:001", "type":"Product",
      "name":{
        "type":"Text", "value":"Beer"
      },
      "size":{
        "type":"Text", "value": "S"
      },
      "price":{
        "type":"Integer", "value": 99
      }
    },
    {
      "id":"urn:ngsi-ld:Product:002", "type":"Product",
      "name":{
        "type":"Text", "value":"Red Wine"
      },
      "size":{
        "type":"Text", "value": "M"
      },
      "price":{
        "type":"Integer", "value": 1099
      }
    },
    {
      "id":"urn:ngsi-ld:Product:003", "type":"Product",
      "name":{
        "type":"Text", "value":"White Wine"
      },
      "size":{
        "type":"Text", "value": "M"
      },
      "price":{
        "type":"Integer", "value": 1499
      }
    },
    {
      "id":"urn:ngsi-ld:Product:004", "type":"Product",
      "name":{
        "type":"Text", "value":"Vodka"
      },
      "size":{
        "type":"Text", "value": "XL"
      },
      "price":{
        "type":"Integer", "value": 5000
      }
    }
  ]
}'
```

In both cases we have encoded each entity `id` according to the NGSI-LD
[specification](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/CIM/001_099/009/01.01.01_60/gs_CIM009v010101p.pdf) - the proposal
is that each `id` is a URN follows a standard format: `urn:ngsi-ld:<entity-type>:<entity-id>`. This will mean that every
`id` in the system will be unique.

Shelf information can be requested by making a GET request on the `/v2/entities` endpoint. For example to return the
context data of the **Shelf** entity with the `id=urn:ngsi-ld:Shelf:unit001`.

#### :three: Request:

```console
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Shelf:unit001/?type=Shelf&options=keyValues'
```

#### Response:

```json
{
    "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Shelf:unit001",
    "type": "Shelf",
    "location": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [13.3986112, 52.554699]
    },
    "maxCapacity": 50,
    "name": "Corner Unit"
}
```

As you can see there are currently three additional property attributes present `location`, `maxCapacity` and `name`

## Creating a one-to-many Relationship

In databases, foreign keys are often used to designate a one-to-many relationship - for example every shelf is found in
a single store and a single store can hold many shelving units. In order to remember this information we need to add an
association relationship similar to a foreign key. Batch processing can again be used to amend the existing the
**Shelf** entities to add a `refStore` attribute holding the relationship to each store. According to the FIWARE Data
Modelling Guidelines on
[linked data](https://fiware-datamodels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guidelines/index.html#modelling-linked-data), when an
entity attribute is used as a link to other entities it should be named with the prefix `ref` plus the name of the
target (linked) entity type.

The value of the `refStore` attribute corresponds to a URN associated to a **Store** entity itself.

The URN follows a standard format: `urn:ngsi-ld:<entity-type>:<entity-id>`

#### :four: Request:

The following request associates three shelves to `urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001` and two shelves to `urn:ngsi-ld:Store:002`

```console
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/op/update' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "actionType":"APPEND",
  "entities":[
    {
      "id":"urn:ngsi-ld:Shelf:unit001", "type":"Shelf",
      "refStore": {
        "type": "Relationship",
        "value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001"
      }
    },
    {
      "id":"urn:ngsi-ld:Shelf:unit002", "type":"Shelf",
      "refStore": {
        "type": "Relationship",
        "value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001"
      }
    },
    {
      "id":"urn:ngsi-ld:Shelf:unit003", "type":"Shelf",
      "refStore": {
        "type": "Relationship",
        "value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001"
      }
    },
    {
      "id":"urn:ngsi-ld:Shelf:unit004", "type":"Shelf",
      "refStore": {
        "type": "Relationship",
        "value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Store:002"
      }
    },
    {
      "id":"urn:ngsi-ld:Shelf:unit005", "type":"Shelf",
      "refStore": {
        "type": "Relationship",
        "value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Store:002"
      }
    }
  ]
}'
```

Now when the shelf information is requested again, the response has changed and includes a new property `refStore`,
which has been added in the previous step.

#### :five: Request:

```console
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Shelf:unit001/?type=Shelf&options=keyValues'
```

#### Response:

The updated response including the `refStore` attribute is shown below:

```json
{
    "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Shelf:unit001",
    "type": "Shelf",
    "location": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [13.3986112, 52.554699]
    },
    "maxCapacity": 50,
    "name": "Corner Unit",
    "refStore": "urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001"
}
```

## Reading a Foreign Key Relationship

### Reading from Child Entity to Parent Entity

We can also make a request to retrieve the `refStore` attribute relationship information from a known **Shelf** entity
by using the `options=values` setting

#### :six: Request:

```console
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Shelf:unit001/?type=Shelf&options=values&attrs=refStore'
```

#### Response:

```json
["urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001"]
```

This can be interpreted as "I am related to the **Store** entity with the `id=urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001`"

### Reading from Parent Entity to Child Entity

Reading from a parent to a child can be done using the `options=count` setting

#### :seven: Request:

```console
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/entities/?q=refStore==urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001&options=count&attrs=type&type=Shelf'
```

This request is asking for the `id` of all **Shelf** entities associated to the URN `urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001`, the
response is a JSON array as shown.

#### Response:

```json
[
    {
        "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Shelf:unit001",
        "type": "Shelf"
    },
    {
        "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Shelf:unit002",
        "type": "Shelf"
    },
    {
        "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Shelf:unit003",
        "type": "Shelf"
    }
]
```

In plain English, this can be interpreted as "There are three shelves in `urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001`". The request can be
altered use the `options=values` and `attrs` parameters to return specific properties of the relevant associated
entities. For example the request:

#### :eight: Request:

```console
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/entities/?q=refStore==urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001&type=Shelf&options=values&attrs=name'
```

Can be interpreted as request for _Give me the names of all shelves in `urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001`_.

#### Response:

```json
[["Corner Unit"], ["Wall Unit 1"], ["Wall Unit 2"]]
```

## Creating many-to-many Relationships

Bridge Tables are often used to relate many-to-many relationships. For example, every store will sell a different range
of products, and each product is sold in many different stores.

In order to hold the context information to "place a product onto a shelf in a given store" we will need to create a new
data entity **InventoryItem** which exists to associate data from other entities. It has a foreign key relationship to
the **Store**, **Shelf** and **Product** entities and therefore requires relationship attributes called `refStore`,
`refShelf` and `refProduct`.

Assigning a product to a shelf is simply done by creating an entity holding the relationship information and any other
additional properties (such as `stockCount` and `shelfCount`)

#### :nine: Request:

```console
curl -iX POST \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/entities' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:InventoryItem:001", "type": "InventoryItem",
    "refStore": {
        "type": "Relationship",
        "value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001"
    },
    "refShelf": {
        "type": "Relationship",
        "value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Shelf:unit001"
    },
    "refProduct": {
        "type": "Relationship",
        "value": "urn:ngsi-ld:Product:001"
    },
    "stockCount":{
        "type":"Integer", "value": 10000
    },
    "shelfCount":{
        "type":"Integer", "value": 50
    }
}'
```

## Reading from a bridge table

When reading from a bridge table entity, the `type` of the entity must be known.

After creating at least one **InventoryItem** entity we can query _Which products are sold in `urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001`?_
by making the following request

#### :one::zero: Request:

```console
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/entities/?q=refStore==urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001&options=values&attrs=refProduct&type=InventoryItem'
```

#### Response:

```json
[["urn:ngsi-ld:Product:prod001"]]
```

Similarly we can request _Which stores are selling `urn:ngsi-ld:Product:001`?_ by altering the request as shown:

#### :one::one: Request:

```console
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/entities/?q=refProduct==urn:ngsi-ld:Product:001&options=values&attrs=refStore&type=InventoryItem'
```

#### Response:

```json
[["urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001"]]
```

## Data Integrity

Context data relationships should only be set up and maintained between entities that exist - in other words the URN
`urn:ngsi-ld:<entity-type>:<entity-id>` should link to another existing entity within the context. Therefore we must
take care when deleting an entity that no dangling references remain. Imagine `urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001` is deleted - what
should happen to the associated the **Shelf** entities?

It is possible to make a request to see if any remaining entity relationship exists prior to deletion by making a
request as follows

#### :one::two: Request:

```console
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:1026/v2/entities/?q=refStore==urn:ngsi-ld:Store:001&options=count&attrs=type'

#### :one::three: Request:

The response lists a series of **Shelf** and **InventoryItem** entities - there are no **Product** entities since there
is no direct relationship between product and store.

```json
[
    {
        "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Shelf:unit001",
        "type": "Shelf"
    },
    {
        "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Shelf:unit002",
        "type": "Shelf"
    },
    {
        "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Shelf:unit003",
        "type": "Shelf"
    },
    {
        "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:InventoryItem:001",
        "type": "InventoryItem"
    }
]
```

If this request returns an empty array, the entity has no associates.
